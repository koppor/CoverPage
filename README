%    The CoverPage Package
%    ========================
%    
%    What it does:
%    
%       The package \texttt{CoverPage} was created to supplement
%       scientific papers with a cover page containing bibliographical
%       information, a copyright notice, and/or some logos of the author's
%       institution. The cover page is created (almost) automatically; this 
%       is done by parsing \BibTeX{} information corresponding to the
%       main document and reading a configuration file in which the author
%       can set information like the affiliation he or she is associated with.
%       
%    Required packages:
%       
%       This package needs four other packages (\texttt{keyval}, \texttt{url},
%       \texttt{textcomp}, and \texttt{verbatim}), but all of them are standard 
%       packages and should be part of every \LaTeX{} installation.
%    
%    Installation:
%       
%       The package \texttt{CoverPage} is distributed as dtx archive.
%       If you do not know how to install such archives, see documentation 
%       "CoverPage.pdf" (for a short description) or look at some FAQ list,
%       e.g. http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages.
